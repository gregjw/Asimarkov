*Asimarkov* is a portmonteau of [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov) and [Andrey Markov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov), whose real work made this random silly experiment possible.
Thanks for the hard work guys. Truely appreciated.
  
The writing quality is low and what is spurts out is eloquent gibberish. However, with continued development, hopefully Asimarkov gets smarter and hopefully it's writing gets clearer and better formatted.

To use this yourself, just download the project and load your `.txt` format corpuses into a folder called `library`.
